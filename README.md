# Bravo Car Rental Software

[Jira Projekt lÃ¤nk](https://mikaelmirke.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/YB/boards/3)

## How To Postman

There is a JSON file called `Postman_CarRental.postman_collection.json` in the project that can be use in Postman.
To add it in Postman: 
* Top left corner there's three bars that you can click on. (Also works to press Ctrl + O)
* In the menu click on File -> Import 
* You can pull the `Postman_CarRental.postman_collection.json` file inside where it says "Drop anywhere to import".
* Lastly it should load CarRental, which contains folder Customer(customer commands) and Admin(admin commands).
